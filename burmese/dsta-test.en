We cannot forgive the incident yesterday at Kachin state even though we are happy to regain the internet connection. If we forget about it, we will be divided with our ethnic brothers who are going to war together to topple the dictators. The military terrorized the Kachin people, who are without weapons, yesterday.

Although they protested by shouting, "Oppose the military, continue CDM," they are now sending their own children to the school. What an ugly science.
We can deduce how big the insecurity of the military dictators is by looking at their efforts to celebrate the name-changing ceremony of a bridge. They haven't done anything proper ever since the coup. #thoserunningadogshow_inthecountry_withresentment #mustfail #revolution_mustwin https://t.co/ThhDjKw2kB
The interview from @bbcburmese was as low as the state administration council, and the questions were also the same as leaking information. Therefore I strongly condemn that interview. @bbcburmese must be aware that it is very dangerous to ask this kind of question during the revolution..
